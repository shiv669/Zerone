## 🚀 Overview — Rethinking Waste, Reimagining Survival

**Zerone** is not just a recycling machine—it's a self-contained ecosystem designed to transform inorganic waste into essential materials and power, making sustainable living possible anywhere, from the Martian surface to the most remote regions on Earth.

Zerone is inspired by the challenges of life on Mars, where everything—air, water, tools—must be made from what you have. Leveraging vision-based AI and advanced material processing, Zerone enables habitats to thrive without constant resupply, turning trash into tomorrow’s building blocks.

## 🪐 Why is Zerone Needed?

### The Martian Challenge

On Mars, resources are precious and resupply from Earth is slow, expensive, and uncertain. Mars’ surface is covered in regolith, a rocky soil, and its thin atmosphere and temperature swings present unique challenges ([Mars Science, NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/mars/facts/)).  
NASA’s Perseverance rover explores Jezero Crater, a region once filled with water but now dry and barren ([Explore Jezero Crater](https://images.nasa.gov/details/JPL-20211221-M2020f-0001-Explore_Mars_Jezero_Crater_with_NASAs_Perseverance_Rover)).  
Settlers will need to recycle every scrap of material to build, repair, and shield their habitats.

```
- **Typical Power Use**: 60–150W per cycle (peak).
- **Recovered Energy**: Up to 40% of expended energy is channeled back.
- **Why it works on Mars**: Energy is always at a premium. Zerone’s feedback ensures minimal waste and maximum autonomy.

## 🏜️ Designed for Mars, Built for Earth

- **Inspired by Martian regolith simulant research** ([UCF Mars Simulant](https://sciences.ucf.edu/class/simulant_marsglobal/))  
  Zerone’s modules are made to handle abrasive, dusty environments and non-Earth materials.
- **Jezero Crater as Model Habitat**  
  The Perseverance rover’s mission in Jezero Crater ([Explore Jezero Crater Delta](https://images.nasa.gov/details/JPL-20220906-Perseverance_Explores_Jezero_Crater_Delta_UHD)) illustrates the need for robust, multipurpose systems like Zerone to support life in dusty, rocky regions.
- **Earth Applications**:  
  Urban, remote, or disaster-stricken areas can use Zerone for sustainable, on-site recycling.

## 📚 Mars Facts & Zerone’s Role

- A single Mars mission can generate kilograms of mixed waste per week—Zerone ensures none is wasted.
- Mars’ regolith is fine and abrasive—modules are designed to cope with this, using sealed bearings and dust-proof seals.
- In habitats like those envisioned for Jezero Crater, every recycled gram counts towards survival.
